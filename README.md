# Archlinux Mirrorlist Updater

A simple bash script for updating the Archlinux's mirrorlist file. Normally, what I would do if I am updating mirrorlist on my computer, I would first make sure I have a fresh .pacnew file. Then I create a backup of my actual mirrorlist file. After that I also make a copy of my .pacnew file and have it a .backup extension. And so on and so forth.

This script basically simplifies all of that. So I just run this simple script and it does everything that I need to update my mirrorlist.

<h3>HOW TO USE THIS SCRIPT:</h3>
    <p>1. Download this script and place it in your home directory (Ex. /home/greencloud/mirupdater.sh)</p>
    2. Open up a terminal and login as root
    3. Make sure this file is executable ($ chmod +x mirupdater.sh)
    4. Then simply run this file like so: # ./mirupdater.sh
    
The whole process might take a few minutes depending on your connection. Hope this one helps. Cheers!
