# Archlinux Mirrorlist Updater

A simple bash script for updating the Archlinux's mirrorlist file. Normally, what I would do if I am updating mirrorlist on my computer, I would first make sure I have a fresh .pacnew file. Then I create a backup of my actual mirrorlist file. After that I also make a copy of my .pacnew file and have it a .backup extension. And so on and so forth.

This script basically simplifies all of that. So I just run this simple script and it does everything that I need to update my mirrorlist.
